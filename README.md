# Processor_simulation
 big final project for ece550

## 1. Information about authors
Name： **Changhao Li & Junfeng Zhi**  
NetID： **cl580 & jz399**

## 2. Description of desgin implementation
### for Project1 checkpoint
using nested CSA to implment addition and subtraction operation. 
### for Project2 checkpoint
using 32 bit AND gate and 32 bit OR gate to achieve bitwise and/or operation.  
enabling to check isLessThan and isNotEqual output when doing substract operation.  
using barrel shifter model to achieve logic left shift and arithmetic right shift.  
using 8:3 decoder and tri-state buffer to select data_result according to ALU_opcode.  
### for Project3 checkpoint
achieving 32 bit register and use it to build register file.  
special treatment to reg$0.  
using 8:3 decoder and 2:4 decoder to achieve 5:32 decoder.  
using tri-state gate to achieve selecting corresponding output of register files.  
our register file will work normally at 50kHZ clock.
